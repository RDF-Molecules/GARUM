# GARUM
A Semantic Similarity Measure Based on Machine Learning and Entity Characteristics

We address the problem of similarity assessment between knowledge graph entities and devise GARUM, a semantic similarity 
measure for knowledge graphs. GARUM relies on similarities of entity characteristics and computes similarity values considering simultaneously several entity characteristics. This combination can be manually or automatically defined with the help of a machine learning approach.

# Setting up GARUM
Once you have downloaded the code from GitHub:

* Unpack the resources.zip file in the same directory
* Run main.py
